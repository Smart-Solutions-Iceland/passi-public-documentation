Almost every option from the site is available in a publicly documentated API for developers to integrate the platform into their own systems.

The platform uses GraphQL to query and manipulate the data. The backend is hosted on `api.passi.is <https://api.passi.is>`_. To query the server via GraphQL you should send the requests to `api.passi.is/graphql <https://api.passi.is/graphql>`_.

The documentation for the queries available in the backend can be found at our playground. The playground is hosted on api.passi.is/playground. On the right side of the screen you can expand "DOCS" and search through the documentation for what you need.

To get started you can follow the steps on the following :ref:`get started page <Making a simple request>` to make your first graphQL query and mutation. But first you should go ahead and :ref:`create a new API-key <Generating new API keys>` to authorize the requests.
